	<h2>Its My First Trial On Git</h2>
	<p>Git and GitHub are two of the most popular technologies around for developers. 
	Git, despite its complexity and rather terse beginnings, 
	is the version control tool of choice for everyone from web designers to kernel developers. 
	And GitHub is the social code-hosting platform used more than any other. 
	On GitHub, youâ€™ll find everything from playful, simple experiments to the Linux kernel itself.
